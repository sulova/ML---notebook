# ML Notebooks 

Here are some commonly used machine learning models in Jupyter Notebook:

- Scikit-learn: Scikit-learn is a popular Python library for machine learning. It provides a range of supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms, including classification, regression, clustering, and dimensionality reduction. Some examples of scikit-learn models that can be used in Jupyter Notebook include Decision Trees, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines (SVM), and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN).

- TensorFlow: TensorFlow is an open-source library for machine learning developed by Google. It is widely used for deep learning and neural network-based models. Some examples of TensorFlow models that can be used in Jupyter Notebook include Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), and Autoencoders.

- Keras: Keras is a high-level neural networks API written in Python and runs on top of TensorFlow. It provides a simple interface for building neural networks and can be used for a wide range of tasks, including image classification, text analysis, and more.

- PyTorch: PyTorch is another popular open-source machine learning library developed by Facebook. It is widely used for deep learning and supports a range of neural network architectures. Some examples of PyTorch models that can be used in Jupyter Notebook include Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), and Generative Adversarial Networks (GAN).

To use these models in Jupyter Notebook, you need to install the required libraries and import them into your notebook. You can then use the models to train and evaluate your machine learning models on your dataset.
